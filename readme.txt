This script does a 'ping' of each IP address and reports success or failure.

It runs in a loop each 60 seconds (or whatever you set)

The output is written to ip_check.log as well as the console.

First time setup:
1. Make sure OneDrive is running.
2. Open a PowerShell as Administrator and:
`Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned`

then each time you want to run it:
`run.bat`
